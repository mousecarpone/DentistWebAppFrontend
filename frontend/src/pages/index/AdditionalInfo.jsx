      question: "How often should I visit the dentist?",
      answer: "We recommend a checkup and cleaning every six months. Patients with specific conditions may benefit from more frequent visits."
    },
    {
      question: "What’s the difference between a cleaning and deep cleaning?",
      answer: "A standard cleaning removes surface plaque and tartar. A deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) is more involved and targets bacteria below the gumline to treat gum disease."
    },
    {
      question: "Are X-rays really necessary?",
      answer: "Yes. X-rays allow us to detect issues that aren't visible to the naked eye—such as cavities between teeth, bone loss, or impacted teeth."
    },
    {
      question: "Is teeth whitening safe?",
      answer: "When done properly under supervision, yes. We offer professional whitening that is both safe and effective without damaging enamel."
    },
    {
      question: "What can I do about sensitive teeth?",
      answer: "Use a toothpaste designed for sensitivity and avoid acidic foods. If sensitivity persists, we’ll check for receding gums or enamel wear."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do my gums bleed when I brush?",
      answer: "This is often an early sign of gum inflammation or gingivitis. Consistent brushing, flossing, and professional cleanings can help reverse it."
