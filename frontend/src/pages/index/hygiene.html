      <p class="intro-text">Maintaining good oral hygiene is essential for your overall health. Here are answers to some common questions about dental hygiene.</p>
      
      <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>How often should I brush my teeth?</h2>
          <p>You should brush your teeth at least twice a day, in the morning and before bed. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Brush for two minutes, ensuring you clean all surfaces of your teeth.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>Is flossing really necessary?</h2>
          <p>Yes, flossing is essential! Flossing removes plaque and food particles from between your teeth where your toothbrush can't reach. You should floss at least once a day to prevent cavities and gum disease.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>How often should I visit the dentist?</h2>
          <p>Most people should visit the dentist for a check-up and cleaning every six months. However, your dentist may recommend more frequent visits based on your oral health needs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>What causes bad breath?</h2>
          <p>Bad breath (halitosis) can be caused by poor oral hygiene, food particles trapped in the teeth, dry mouth, tobacco use, certain medications, infections, or underlying health conditions. Regular brushing, flossing, and tongue cleaning can help prevent bad breath.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>How can I prevent cavities?</h2>
          <p>To prevent cavities: brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, limit sugary and acidic foods and drinks, avoid frequent snacking, use a fluoride mouthwash if recommended by your dentist, and visit your dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h2>What is gum disease?</h2>
          <p>Gum disease (periodontal disease) is an infection of the tissues that hold your teeth in place. It's typically caused by poor brushing and flossing habits that allow plaque to build up on the teeth and harden. In advanced stages, gum disease can lead to sore, bleeding gums, painful chewing problems, and even tooth loss.</p>
